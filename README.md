# Assignment: Create the “About Us” Page

- Create your own **React app** (note: this one will be your one project for all the tasks in this course).  
- Push it to your own **repository**  
- The **About Us** page must contain your **shared contacts** (not your address or any sensitive data, please).  
- The page can be added to the **main component** for now.  
- Use **JSX + CSS**, `className` for style classes.  
- All the CSS you can insert into **one file** for now (be ready to refactor later).
